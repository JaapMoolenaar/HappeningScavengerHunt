# Scavenger Hunt
This is a group app for Happening.

Users or players have to make their way across town/country/world to check-in at certain locations, aided only by a description or picture. The hunts are created by players (they earn points too as other players find their objectives!).

## Creating a hunt
When creating a hunt, the following fields are available:

 * Title
 * Description (optional)
 * [] Objectives must be finished in order (Either all objectives have to be found in order, or at random. __careful__: this option can only be picked when creating a hunt! )
 * Photo (This field is available when editing the hunt) (optional)

After you're done adding your hunt, you need to edit it to add objectives (open the hunt then use the top-right button to go to the edit screen).

 * Title
 * Description (optional)
 * Hint (optional)
 * Extra information to show when the objective is found (useful to guide the player towards the next objective) (optional)
